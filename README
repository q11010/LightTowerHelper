Simple Bilibili Lighthouse Project

When provided with a BVID or a live room number, this program will analyse
the danmaku frequency, and use it to determine whether or not a timestamp
is a potentially interesting enough to be clipped.

The tool also allows the monitoring of danmakus from certain users, so that
authorized users can quickly add timestamps while watching the stream.

To use, download the release build, and run the executable with argument
'--alive' for monitering live streams, or '--unalive' for analysing stream
archive.

After analysing a playback, the script will also open a web portal presenting
all the timestamps found, and allow a human player to review the clips and
filter out any false positives.

Note: one of the dependency used by the project, bilibili_api, is no longer
maintained, and may cause the script to no longer to work in the future.
A rewrite of the script to remove the dependency is planned, but
may not happen for very long time. Use at own risk.

UPDATE: video danmuku part of the bilibili_api is dead, changed to custom implementation.
